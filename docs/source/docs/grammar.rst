Grammar
=======

Only the most basic grammar is supported. This means basic operations with
numbers and dice, and only common dice notation which excludes anything fancy
such as percentile or Fudge dice.

The grammar is generated from code, so it is not included in a file.

--------
Operands

The following values can appear in the grammar as operands:

- Numbers, but only integer values.

----------
